		<p>So, I've decided to trash out the old blog. I did never get to like Jekyll, it's just an ugly and dogshit micro
			CMS, it gave me so many problems, so I've made a cool new site from scratch. Currently, I don't have much time to
			work on writing articles, but I guess the effort will pay out in the future. I'm currently doing a lot of bug
			bounty, and HTB Season 9 starts today, so I'll be keeping an eye on some cool stuff I can write about in the
			future.
