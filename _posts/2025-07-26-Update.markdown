It took time, but I'm finally done with my CBBH certification, and I passed! Expect to hear more from me in this blog, as I'm currently starting a new project: implement every *exotic* post-quantum symmetric encryption algorithm!

I know that probably never has even read my blog yet, but I have it here just to express myself when I need to. If you've read it, you rock!
